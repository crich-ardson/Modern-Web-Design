        <p><span id="graffiti">Graffiti</span> is writing or drawings made on a wall or other surface, usually as a form of artistic expression, without permission and within public view. Graffiti ranges from simple written words to elaborate wall paintings, and has existed since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffito_(archaeology)" target="_blank">ancient times</a>, with examples dating back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" target="_blank">ancient Egypt</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece" target="_blank">ancient Greece</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire" target="_blank">the Roman Empire</a>.</p>
        <p>In modern times, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosol_paint" target="_blank">spray paint</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marker_pen" target="_blank">marker pens</a> have become commonly used graffiti materials, and there are many different types and styles of graffiti, as it is a rapidly developing art form.</p>            
        <p><span id="graffiti">Graffiti</span> is a controversial subject. In most countries, marking or painting property without permission is considered by property owners and civic authorities as defacement and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalism" target="_blank">vandalism</a>, which is a punishable crime, citing the use of graffiti by street gangs to mark territory or to serve as an indicator of gang-related activities. On the other hand, graffiti artists, particularly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion" target="_blank">marginalized</a> artists with no access to mainstream media, resist this viewpoint to display their art or political views in public locations.</p>            
        <p>The life of artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Michel_Basquiat" target="_blank">Jean-Michel Basquiat</a> illustrates the subjective nature of the public response to graffiti. He started out as a street graffiti artist chased by authorities, and later one of his paintings sold for over <abbr aria-label="usd">&#36;</abbr>100,000,000.</p>

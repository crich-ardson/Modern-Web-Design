# Modern-Web-Design
This Repository will serve as the site I develop while working through the Modern Web Design course by Gymnasium. I expect the look and feel to evolve over the course of the class.

I selected Graffiti as the main subject of my page. I hope to not only learn more about the subject as I design the site, but display its beauty and power to any and all visitors.

As of now, I am only utilizing HTML and CSS for the site. In the future Bootstrap and/or other frameworks will come into play.
